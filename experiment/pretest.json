      "question": "1. What happens to the average output voltage of a controlled bridge rectifier as the firing angle increases?",
      "answers": {        
        "a": "Increases",
        "b": "Decreases",
        "c": "Remains constant",

        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 3",
        "d": "Explanation 4: A controlled bridge rectifier allows precise control of the output voltage and power by adjusting the firing angle of the thyristors, which is not the case in uncontrolled rectifier."

        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 3",
        "d": "Explanation 4: Highly inductive loads will not allow sudden change in the current while the current in resistive load follow the voltage."

      "question": "5. What happens when two thyristor of same leg starts conducting?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The input voltage source shorted.",
        "b": "The output load current starts to freewheel.",
        "c": "Source current is same as load current.",
        "d": "Load voltage is same as the source voltage."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation 1: If both thyristors in the same leg of a bridge rectifier conduct simultaneously, it creates a direct short circuit across the input voltage source. ",
