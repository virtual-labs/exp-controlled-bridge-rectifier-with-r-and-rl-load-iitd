### Procedure

#### a) Circuit formulation:<br>
1. Click on the component and place it to its appropriate position by connecting the wires.<br>(OR)<br>Connect the wires to form the circuit i.e. AC input source to the  auto-transformer and the bridge circuit and finally connect the load. Now select the orientation of the switches and place them to its appropriate position.
2. Repeat the above steps to complete the circuit.<br>

#### b) Performance analysis of the circuit:<br>
1. For fixed AC input voltage:- Keeping constant “Load Resistance (R)” vary the “firing angle (α)” from 0&#176; to 180&#176; for resistive load and 0&#176; to 90&#176; for “RL-load”.<br>
2. For fixed firing angle (α):- Keeping constant “Load Resistance (R)” vary the “Source Voltage (vac)” in steps using auto-transformer.<br>
3. Press “RECORD” button to fill the table of observations.<br>
4. To observe various performance characteristics, select the parameter “icons” and then press “PLOT” icon.<br>
5. Repeat the above steps to observe various other performance characteristics for both ‘R’ and ‘RL-load’.<br>
